## Build Command and Configuration


The build command for Cloudflare Pages includes the following flags:


- `-b $CF_PAGES_URL`: This specifies the base URL for the site, which is automatically populated with the Cloudflare Pages deployment URL. This ensures that the URLs in the built site will be relative to the deployment URL for preview purposes.


### Example Cloudflare Pages Build Command:

```bash

hugo -b $CF_PAGES_URL

```


This command is used during the build process to set the correct base URL for your site. Cloudflare Pages automatically provides the `$CF_PAGES_URL` environment variable, which points to the deployed siteâ€™s URL.


## SEO Control (Adding noindex)

This project allows you to control SEO settings and the behavior of the `robots` meta tag during the build process based on the environment. 

### Production (Default)
By default, the `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">` tag is included in the build output.

### Development Environment (Cloudflare Pages)
When building with `-e development`, the `noindex` tag is automatically added, and the output will be `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`.

#### Setup for Cloudflare Pages
1. In the Cloudflare Pages settings, add `-e development` to the build command.

   Example Cloudflare Pages build command:
   ```bash
   hugo -e development
   ```


## Local Development

To run the site locally for editing or testing:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mimoex/CANS2025_Website.git
