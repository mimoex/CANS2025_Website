It is imperative that authors and attendees allow sufficient time to obtain visas.
Participants from countries that have visa exemption agreements with Japan (such as EU nations, USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) do not need a visa for short-term stays. Many other nationalities will require a visa. We strongly recommend checking the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan for the most up-to-date and detailed information regarding entry visas and residence permits.

We also recommend contacting the Japanese embassy or consulate nearest to you. If an entry visa is required, please allow sufficient time for this procedure. Upon entering Japan, even if you have a visa, border authorities are authorized to check again the documents required for the issuance of the visa.

Please note that visa invitation letters will only be issued to individuals who have completed the registration process and paid the registration fee. Requests submitted without payment or without a clear explanation of the purpose of participation may be disregarded without response. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
